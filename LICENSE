Copyright segfaultdev, 2021

This project is distributed with the nop license version 1.0:

Distribution of this project, with or without modification, is permitted as
long as this license and file are not modified and publicly available along
with the rest of the project, attribution to the author(s) is kept/added and
publicly available and the source code is also made publicly available with the
project. Additionally, all of the files that were originally provided with the
project must keep this license, although additional files can use other
licenses. Finally, the author(s) will always have the right to determine if
the terms of the license are not met, forcing the distributors to stop
distributing the content or to change the content accordingly to meet the
terms.

Meanings:

- Author(s): Whoever created the original version of the program and its
  contributors, although the main creator will always have priority in
  decisions. This does include creators and contributors of forks and
  redistributions, although with a lower priority than the original creator and
  its contributors in decisions.

- Redistributions: Unmodified copies of the project made public by someone that
  is not the original author.

- Forks: Modified copies of the project available made public by someone that
  is not the original author.

Modifying the license:

Creating a custom license based off of the nop license is allowed as long as
all authors excluding creators and contributors of forks and redistributions
give their own consent to do so. However, the custom license must have a
different name to this one. Renaming an existing version of the license is
not allowed either, so a new license must be created.
